# SimPy
Repository of files for simulations using SimPY

The initial file, simulation.py, uses SimPy to model the movie theater wait time problem from realpython.com. The modifications of the original simulation include a nested for loop to test all combinations of the input variables. The combinations, along with the wait times associated with each, are transferred to a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
